  "project1LongDescription": "My personal project, initiated in 2016 under the name of Personal Account Management with an Excel tool for managing my finances, transformed in July 2023 into a web application, now called My Personal Budget.\n\nThis evolution marks the fruit of my self-taught efforts, enhanced by a web development training focused mainly on the front-end. This transition illustrates my progress and my ability to apply the skills acquired in a tangible way.\n\nThe completion of Version Web 1.0.0 during my training represents a realization of this learning. I designed and developed this project entirely, from front-end to back-end, and ensure its hosting on my personal NAS server.\n\nThis approach demonstrates my total commitment and versatility in all aspects of development.
